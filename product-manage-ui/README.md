## Product Manage UI

simple react app for product management. Uses styled components and react router.

## Getting Started

run `yarn install` to ensure you have all the dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

## Future dev:

Currently I'm not using any gloabl state management, this is because I am using react-router to get params from the url and for easy routing within my app. Future development would have included adding either redux or context.

The use of styled components allows other theming to be used, and also means that if a common style wanted to be changed throughout the whole app, we only have to change it in one place.
